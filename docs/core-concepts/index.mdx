description: Understanding the fundamental concepts of Conjure - templates, bundles, and variables.
---

Before diving into creating your own templates and bundles, it's important to understand the core concepts that make Conjure powerful and flexible.

## Overview

Conjure is a template-driven configuration generator that helps you create consistent, reusable infrastructure and application configurations. At its core, Conjure works with three main concepts:

1. **Templates** - Individual file generators
2. **Bundles** - Collections of related templates
3. **Variables** - Dynamic values that customize your outputs

## Templates vs Bundles

### Templates

A **template** is a single file generator that produces one output file. Think of it as a blueprint for a specific configuration file.

**Use templates when you need to:**
- Generate a single configuration file
- Create standalone artifacts
- Have fine-grained control over individual files
- Reuse the same pattern across different projects

**Example template:**
```
templates/
└── k8s-deployment/
    └── 1.0.0/
        ├── conjure.json       # Metadata file
        └── template.tmpl      # Template file
```

Generates: One Kubernetes Deployment manifest

### Bundles

A **bundle** is a collection of related templates that work together as a cohesive unit. Bundles generate multiple files at once with shared context.

**Use bundles when you need to:**
- Generate multiple related configuration files
- Maintain consistency across related files
- Deploy complete solutions (app + database + networking)
- Share variables across multiple templates

**Example bundle:**
```
bundles/
└── web-app/
    └── 1.0.0/
        ├── conjure.json              # Bundle metadata
        ├── deployment.yaml.tmpl      # Deployment template
        ├── service.yaml.tmpl         # Service template
        └── ingress.yaml.tmpl         # Ingress template
```

Generates: Complete Kubernetes application stack (3 files)

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Template | Bundle |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Output | Single file | Multiple files |
| Variables | Template-specific | Shared + template-specific |
| Use case | Individual configs | Complete solutions |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate to complex |
| Reusability | High | Medium |
| Command | `conjure template` | `conjure bundle` |

## When to Use Each

### Use a Template

```bash
# Generate a single Kubernetes deployment
conjure template k8s-deployment -o deployment.yaml

# Generate a Terraform variable file
conjure template terraform-variables -o variables.tf

# Generate a Docker Compose file
conjure template docker-compose -o docker-compose.yaml
```

**Scenarios:**
- You need just one configuration file
- You're customizing a single component
- You want maximum flexibility
- You're building a library of reusable pieces

### Use a Bundle

```bash
# Generate complete web app infrastructure
conjure bundle web-app -o ./output

# Generate microservices stack
conjure bundle k8s-microservice -o ./k8s
```

**Scenarios:**
- You're deploying a complete application
- Multiple files need to share the same configuration
- You want to ensure consistency across related files
- You're standardizing deployments across teams
