title: Packaging Conjure
description: |-
  For people who want to build and package Conjure for their platform.

<Warning>
**This page is for people who want to build and package Conjure for
others.** If you want to just use Conjure, you should follow the
[installation instructions](/download).
</Warning>

Someday Conjure will use downstream package maintainers to distribute
Conjure to end-users. We greatly appreciate any interest in packaging.

We are working on a packaging guide, but at this time we do not have information to provide. Bear with us as we brew this potion.
