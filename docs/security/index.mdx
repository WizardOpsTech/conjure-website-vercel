Conjure includes multiple security layers to ensure the integrity of templates and bundles fetched from remote repositories.

## SHA256 Verification

Every file downloaded from a remote repository is verified using SHA256 hashing.

**Example error:**
```
Error: SHA256 mismatch for templates/deployment/1.0.0/conjure.json
Expected: 9617f2bb2f1bf6449aebb3af48cf1652bc9b12b2d8f61ae78a8e0b72cdd35f16
Got:      1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

This ensures files have not been tampered with or corrupted during transfer.

## File Size Validation

Files are validated before and after download:

**Pre-download validation:**
- Check expected size from index.json
- Reject files larger than 100 MB
- Prevents downloading extremely large files

**Post-download validation:**
- Verify actual downloaded size matches expected size
- Ensures complete transfer
- Prevents truncated files from being cached

**Maximum file size:** 100 MB (104,857,600 bytes)

## TLS Security

HTTPS connections use strong TLS configuration:

**TLS Version:**
- Minimum: TLS 1.2

**Certificate Verification:**
- Enabled by default
