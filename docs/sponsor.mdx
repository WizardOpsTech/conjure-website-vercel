title: Support Conjure Development
description: |
  Conjure is an open-source template generation tool used to enable DevOps practitioners, Platform Engeineers, and Developers.
  Community contributions help sustain development.

Conjure is developed as an open-source project by the WizardOps team.
We believe DevOps tooling and infrastructure automation are critical
technologies for modern software development and operations.

We also believe in enabling the less experienced and 
creating magic to abstract away some of the complexities 
developers have to deal with day-to-day.
